                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

                    <li>
                        <a href = "https://www.google.com">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span>var x;</span>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href = "https://www.google.com"></a> Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span>var x= 10;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href = "https://www.google.com">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean, <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> nlil - nlil aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!;"</span> Array - <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href = "https://www.google.com">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements:<span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;<span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href = "https://www.google.com">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href = "https://www.google.com">Functions</a> Functions are an encapsliation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished out instructions. Sadly there a a ton more table to do so lets call our function over and over again.
